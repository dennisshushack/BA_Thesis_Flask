      This Ransomware Detctor was built during a BA thesis project. It is a web application that can be used to detect Ransomware. To detect 
      these anomalies Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, One Class Support Vector Machine and Autoencoders are utilized.
      Logistic Regression is used for classification. Different behavioral sources were measured including Hardware performance counters, system calls,
      ressource usage, process usage, and network usage etc.
